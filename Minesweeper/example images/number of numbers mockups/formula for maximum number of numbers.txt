beginner
9 * 9 tiles (81)
10 mines

81 / 9 = 9

9 / 10 can be spaced out evenly
1 is left

if the game had just 9 mines then the entire board could be 9 mines
evenly spaced out and every other tile (72 of them) would have the number 1 written in it

since there is actually 1 left there wll be a maximum of 71 (72 - 1) tiles with numbers
on them if spaced out as evenly as possible

intermediate
16 * 16 tiles (256)
40 mines

256 / 9 = 28.444...

28 / 40 can be spaced out evenly
12 are left

if the game had just 28 mines then the entire board could be 9 mines
evenly spaced out and every other tile (228 of them) would have the number 1 written in it

since there are actually 12 left there will be a maximum of 216 (228 - 12) tiles with numbers 
on them if spaced out as evenly as possible

advanced
16 * 30 tiles (480)
99 mines

480 / 9 = 53 + 1/3

53 / 99 can be spaced out evenly
46 are left

if game had just 53 mines then the entire board could be 53 mines
evenly spaced out and every other tile (427 of them) would have the number 1 written in it


since there are actually 46 left there will be a maximum of 381 (427 - 46) tiles with numbers 
on them if spaced out as evenly as possible
